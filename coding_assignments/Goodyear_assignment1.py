# Goodyear - Coding Assignment 1 CS 307
# Part 1: Define the variables

name = "Sarah Goodyear" # my name

age = 21 # my age

favorite_number = 2 # my favorite number

 

# Part 2: Print basic information

print("Hello, my name is ", name) # prints "Hello, my name is Sarah Goodyear" using predefiend name variable

print("I am ", age, " years old.") # prints "I am 21 years old" using predefined age variable

print("My favorite number is ", favorite_number) # prints my favorite number is 2 using predefined favorite_number variable

 

# Part 3: Calculate the next age

next_age = age + 1 # calculate the next year with age variable and store in next_age

print("Next year, I will be ", next_age, " years old.") # print how old I will be next year with next_age variable

 

# Part 4: Ask for user input

favorite_color = input("What is your favorite color? ") # prompt user for input of their favorite color and store in variable

print("Your favorite color is ", favorite_color) # print favorite color using favorite_color variable

 

# Part 5: Perform a simple arithmetic operation

num1 = float(input("Enter a number: ")) # prompt user for number input

num2 = float(input("Enter another number: ")) # prompt user for another number input

sum_of_numbers = num1 + num2 # add the 2 numbers stored from user input and store sum

print("The sum of ", num1, " and ", num2, " is ", sum_of_numbers) # print the 2 numbers stored from user input and their sum
